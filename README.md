## ⚠ Quick Start
> - Latest Jar: import this jar as a Library to your project and start using the infrastructures > [GDIS-JAR]().
####🔌 [Demo](https://github.com/attiasas/GameDevIS/tree/master/src/demo) - Collection of Mini-Projects using GDIS

## ✨ Main Components:
> 📦 [Tools](https://github.com/attiasas/GameDevIS/tree/master/src/GDIS/tools) (Utilities) - general tools that can support and used while implementing games and simulations.
>
> 📦 [Engine](https://github.com/attiasas/GameDevIS/tree/master/src/GDIS/engine) - the main package, contains the infrastructures needed to run game/simulation.
